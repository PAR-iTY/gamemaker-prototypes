///Collide test

//other.x /= 1.2;
//other.y /= 1.2;
//instance_find(obj_player, 0)
//instance_deactivate_object(other);
//enemyX = other.x;
//enemyY = other.y;

TO FIX:
make obj box collisions generously small
place wooden wall item (as non-solid?) with delta_time movement (or delta + a player component)
